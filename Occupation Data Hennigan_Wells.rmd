# Compilation of Occupational COVID-19 Reports for Calculations

- **This notebook retrieves data from a Google sheet and compiles a time series of ADH occupational infection reports**

-**It will create a masterfile: occupation_master.csv**

#Import 329 records of company names and dates.

names$Date <- ymd(names$Date)
write.csv(names,"names.csv")
glimpse(names)
```
#Join the Industry and Names Files

#Howard Center People Start Here:
```{r}
#329 records from Sept 17 to Jan 28
names <- rio::import("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/profrobwells/Spring2021Data/main/names.csv")
#311 records from Sept 28 to Feb 1
industry_master <- rio::import("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/profrobwells/Spring2021Data/main/industry_master.csv")


#This is the first problem: ADH gave us more names than industry records. Check that Sept 17 doesn't have 18 record that would account for the difference.

```

#We now join the industry db with a list of company names and dates

```{r}
joined_industry_names <- industry_master %>% 
  inner_join(names, by=c("date"="Date", "city"="City", "county"="County"))

write.csv(joined_industry_names,"joined_indstry_names.csv")

#Now 375 records. 64 extra than the source industry file

#Problem: 369 records, 58 extra than the source industry file
#It is posting double entries on some dates
```

#Possible Fix: Have them all the same date period: Sept 28-Jan 28
```{r}
#318 records
names2 <- names %>% 
  filter(Date >= "2020-09-28")

#307 records
industry_master2 <- industry_master %>% 
  filter(date >= ("2020-09-28")) %>% 
  filter(date <= ("2021-01-28"))
```
#What's messed up about this is the ADH gave us records for 11 more cases than what they reported.
#We should check to see if we have all the records by date for the names and industry master - see if there are some date or record gaps in industry master

#Anyway, we join again
```{r}
joined2 <- industry_master2 %>% 
  inner_join(names2, by=c("date"="Date", "city"="City", "county"="County"))


#Problem: Still 375 records, now 68 extra than the source industry file
#It is still posting double entries on some dates
```

#End of dilemma#


```{r}
nomatches <- industry_date %>% 
  anti_join(names_date, by=c("date"="Date", "n"="n"))
nomatches
#Oct 10, 5 records not in the Names file
#Nov 16 11 in names but 10 in industry
#Jan 18 14 in names but 15 in industry
#Feb 1 4 records not in Names file

```

#This section is aimed at running down the duplication

```{r}
names_original <- names %>% 
  count(`Business Name`)
```

#68 records in the joined file
```{r}
