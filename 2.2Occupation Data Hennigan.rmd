# Compilation of Occupational COVID-19 Reports for Calculations

- **This notebook retrieves data from a Google sheet and compiles a time series of ADH occupational infection reports**

--**This 1/26 version created a time series from May 17 - Aug 20**

-**It will create a masterfile: occupation_master.csv**
